# CLAUDE.md — linux-ct

A **content repo**, not an app. It holds the **Linux** concept, authored **video-first**
for the `graphl-movie` app (sibling repo), which loads it **at runtime**. No render
engine and no scenes live here — the app fetches this repo's `manifest.json` + notebooks
+ slides over the network and renders/records them. Read alongside the workspace map in
`../CLAUDE.md`, the app contract in `../graphl-movie/CLAUDE.md`, and the sibling
video-first content repos `../aws-ct/CLAUDE.md` and `../apache-spark-ct/CLAUDE.md`.

This is a `-ct` (video-target) content repo. It is authored **fresh** for the video
target — the existing graphl-ux-era `../linux-content` (whole-notebook, feed/canvas era)
is **reference material**, not something to copy wholesale. We refine structure for
video, not port it.

Concretely, each module's section notebooks are **split from the `../linux-content`
per-module notebook** — the source of truth for the split — then refined for the video
target (trimmed to the agreed spine, `## `-per-section, images dropped). Example: module
02's sections split from `../linux-content/notebooks/02-the-shell-and-its-mechanics.ipynb`.

There is **nothing to build, run, or test** here. The one executable (later) is a Colab
tool that turns `tts/` scripts into `audio/` `.wav`s.

## Working agreement

Same as the app repo: **step by step, one small slice, review gate between each.** We
settle the shape first (module spine → sections → …), then fill content deliberately. No
batch generation, no "I generated 12 files" — list files and get a yes.

## The core contract (from graphl-movie — do not break)

1. **The notebook is the single source of truth** for a section's prose and code.
   `manifest.json` only *wires* — it must never duplicate notebook content.
2. **One notebook per section** (not per module): each `.ipynb` holds exactly one `## `
   section. The section is the atomic unit across all four artifacts — `.ipynb` + `.tts`
   + `.slide` + `.wav` share the same `NN-SS-slug` stem — so a section can be authored and
   reviewed on its own. The manifest references each artifact by path; the notebook's
   single `## ` heading is the section title (mirror it in the manifest `heading`).
3. Each section is the unit the video steps through and has its own **`.ipynb`**
   (prose/code), **`.tts`** (narration script), **`.wav`** (generated audio), and — new
   for video — a **`.slide`** file (the authored right-pane bullets). Module title/lede
   lives in `README.md` + the manifest, not in the section notebooks.
4. A section's diagram images (`![]()`) are **stripped** by the app — the React Flow
   **scene** replaces them.
5. **Scenes live in the `graphl-movie` app** (`src/scenes/*`), authored with the engine's
   pattern helpers. Here you only reference a scene **by id**, plus `highlight` (node ids
   brightened in-place, the rest dimmed) and `focus` (a node id the camera frames) per
   section. Linux rides a **single dense scene** — `linux`, ported into graphl-movie from
   `../graphl-ux/src/scenes/linux.ts`, refined for the 1920×1080 video frame. Every module
   frames one band/subsystem of that one map (`lx-*` node ids).

## Folder layout

```
linux-ct/
  notebooks/   # one .ipynb per SECTION (one ## section each) — source of truth for prose/code
  tts/         # one .tts per section (plain spoken narration script)
  audio/       # one .wav per section (generated from tts/ via Colab)
  slides/      # one .slide per section (authored right-pane title + bullets)
  manifest.json  # wires sections → notebook / slide / scene / highlight / focus / audio
  scripts/     # (later) colab_generate_audio.ipynb (.tts -> .wav)
  CLAUDE.md · README.md
```

Naming: every artifact for a section shares the stem `<NN>-<SS>-<slug>`, where `NN` =
module number, `SS` = section position (so a sorted glob stays in reading order):
`notebooks/<NN>-<SS>-<slug>.ipynb`, `tts/…​.tts` → `audio/…​.wav`, `slides/…​.slide`.

The `.slide` format is a one-screen, scannable Markdown subset — **not** just title +
bullets: a `# Title`, then `## ` sub-labels, short paragraphs, fenced ` ```code``` `
blocks, and numbered / `- ` lists, each key term marked with inline **`**bold**`**
(rendered bright white, the rest a softer gray). **Keep the whole slide inside the fixed
1920×1080 frame:** the app's right pane does not scroll or auto-shrink type, so an
over-long slide clips top and bottom — trim it to fit (drop connective prose the narration
already carries) rather than expecting the engine to resize. Title may be punchier than
the notebook `## ` heading.

## Audio

The `.tts` scripts are **re-authored fresh** for the video target — never reuse a
graphl-ux-era `.wav`. `audio/` stays empty until the **owner** generates the `.wav`s from
`tts/` via Colab (`scripts/colab_generate_audio.ipynb`, added later); the manifest `audio`
fields are wired back in after generation.

## Curriculum

The course outline (module spine + per-module sections) lives in [`README.md`](./README.md)
— the single human-facing source for structure while we plan; `manifest.json` becomes the
machine source of truth once authored. Don't duplicate the module/section list here.

**Starting point:** the 10-module Linux curriculum in `../linux-content` (source of truth
for the split). The video set keeps the 10-module spine, each normalized to ~10 tight
teaching sections.

## Status

**Spine agreed** (10 modules × ~10 sections — see `README.md`) and the `linux` scene is
**ported into graphl-movie** (`src/scenes/linux.ts` + registry + catalog entry). **Module
01 authored end-to-end** — 10 sections × (`.ipynb` + `.slide` + `.tts`), wired in
`manifest.json` (§1 hook on the whole map, §2–10 per-section `focus`/`highlight`), verified
rendering against a local CORS-served copy. `audio/` empty pending the owner's Colab run.
Modules 02–10 next, same pattern. Intended remote: `github.com/schemabotview/linux-ct`.
